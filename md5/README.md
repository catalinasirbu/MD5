	Given a MD5 hash, find a string that produces that hash. To simplify, only look for strings of a given length (eg one block length).

	String format: the length of the block is 4 and it consists of lowercase letters and numbers.

	To exemplify the functionality of the code, the password "abc8" was used with the corresponding hash "275a9c70bf8f48e9a54540e3962579c3".
